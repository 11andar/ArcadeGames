# Snake Game

Welcome to the Snake game directory!

## About

This directory contains the code for a classic Snake game implemented in Python. Snake is a popular arcade game where player controls a snake that grows in length as it eats food while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls.

## Usage

To play the Snake game, simply run the `main.py` file using Python. You can customize the game settings and controls within the code itself.

## Controls

- Arrow keys:
  - Up: Move snake up
  - Down: Move snake down
  - Left: Move snake left
  - Right: Move snake right

- WSAD:
  - W: Move snake up
  - S: Move snake down
  - A: Move snake left
  - D: Move snake right

## Objective

The objective of the Snake game is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake itself. As the snake consumes food, it grows longer and slightly increases moving speed making the game progressively more challenging.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed on your system to run the game.
